When you print something with Python (or any other language), you want to control the format of what you write: do you want to write a string? An integer?  decimal? floating point?  That's where _formatted_ print comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formatted Printing: The standard way\n",

    "\n",
    "Fortunately, these are pretty easy to figure out: ```%s``` (e.g. \"yo\") for string, ```%d``` or ```%i``` for decimal integers (e.g. 5), ```%f``` for floating point (e.g. 3.141569), ```%e``` for lower case exponential notation (e.g. 1.41569e+03), etc.  There are a few others but these are the most important ones for now.   \n",

    "Now what if there's a Python package that you want to install?  Well, you have a couple of options.  The two most common installation methods are using ``conda`` -- if you have the Anaconda distribution of Python -- or ``pip``.   If the thing you are wanting to install is a very nice, official package (e.g. ``numpy``), it should have its own installer script that you can use from ``conda`` or ``pip``.  \n",

    "Some caveats.  First, ``conda`` is SLOW: it will carefully check for (what it thinks are) package incompatibilities.  And if you are not careful, it may start overwriting packages you currently have to solve the incompatibility.   Or conversely, ``pip`` might do an installation or upgrade that breaks packages a bit more easily.\n",
